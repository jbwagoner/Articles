JB Wagoner stands as a visionary at the confluence of software engineering, cognitive science, and ethical AI development. With over thirty years of experience, he has evolved from a cognitive psychologist at UC Irvine, where he probed the depths of learning and memory, to a leading software engineer known for his groundbreaking work. His early project, Dr. Xes for the Commodore Amiga in 1986, marked him as a pioneer by incorporating speech synthesis and adaptive learning, laying early foundations in conversational AI.

As both a cognitive scientist and software engineer, Wagoner has a unique insight into how intelligence functions across biological and digital realms. His pivotal role in crafting the SUTRA ethical framework underscores his dedication to ensuring AI's alignment with human values. SUTRA, inspired by the "Noble Eightfold Digital Path," is his solution to the pressing need for ethical AI, offering developers and investors a guide to building AI that goes beyond technical excellence to make tangible, positive societal impacts.

Despite a successful stint in the spirits industry, where he was among the first to produce agave spirits in the U.S., Wagoner left due to ethical conflicts and considerations, reflecting his deep-seated commitment to ethical practices in all his endeavors. This decision mirrors his approach to AI development - prioritizing ethical alignment over commercial success.

A former PCAA High Jump Champion, Wagoner's tenacity and vision are evident in his work. His books are compelling reads for developers and investors, providing a rich narrative that intertwines technical expertise with ethical considerations. They are essential for anyone committed to shaping an AI future where technology serves humanity responsibly.

His broad experience, from Mars Colony X's award-winning designs to his ethical pivot from the spirits industry, enriches his writing, offering a multi-faceted perspective on how to navigate the complex landscape of AI development with integrity and foresight.

For those in the tech sector looking to invest in or develop AI, JB Wagoner's books are indispensable, providing the technical depth and ethical wisdom necessary to lead the field into a future where AI is both innovative and benevolent.
